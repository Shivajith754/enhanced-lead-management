- **Customizable UI**: Provides a Lightning Web Component for capturing and managing leads with a user-friendly interface.
- **Comprehensive Unit Testing**: Includes robust test classes to ensure functionality and maintain high code coverage.

## Components

### **Triggers**
- **`LeadScoringTrigger`**: Handles lead scoring, assignment, and email notifications.

### **Apex Classes**
- **`LeadCaptureFormController`**: Handles backend logic for the Lightning Web Component.
- **`LeadNotificationHelper`**: Manages email notifications for assigned leads.
- **`LeadNotificationHelperTest`**: Unit test class for `LeadNotificationHelper`.
- **`LeadScoringTriggerTest`**: Unit test class for `LeadScoringTrigger`.

### **Lightning Web Component**
- **Lead Capture Form**:
  - Collects lead details (name, company, industry, annual revenue, etc.).
  - Provides a clean and intuitive interface for data entry.

## How It Works

### **1. Lead Creation**
- Users can create leads using the Lightning Web Component or directly in Salesforce.

### **2. Lead Scoring**
The trigger calculates a score based on:
- **Industry**:
  - Technology: +10 points
  - Retail: +5 points
  - Others: +1 point
- **Annual Revenue**:
  - >1,000,000: +10 points
  - 500,000 - 1,000,000: +5 points
  - <500,000: +1 point
- **Lead Source**:
  - Web: +10 points
  - Referral: +5 points
  - Others: +2 points

### **3. Lead Assignment**
- **Score â‰¥ 25**: Assigned to senior sales representatives.
- **Score 15 - 24**: Assigned to junior sales representatives.
- **Score < 15**: Assigned to a low-priority queue.

### **4. Email Notifications**
- When a lead is assigned, email notifications are sent to the appropriate sales representative.
